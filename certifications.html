                <p class="about-design-p">
                    I am a First Class Honours Cybersecurity graduate and Dean’s Award recipient with a strong foundation in computer systems, networks, and enterprise 
                    security operations. My academic background spans key cybersecurity domains including Cyber Threat Intelligence, cryptography, risk management, NIST 
                    security frameworks, system administration, cyber defence, and database systems, providing a well-rounded technical and analytical base.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During my year-long industrial placement at Dyson, I gained hands-on experience working within a SOC environment, where I supported security monitoring, 
                    alert triage, incident investigations, and threat analysis. This experience allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios, strengthening 
                    my capabilities in risk assessment, security controls, and operational response to active threats. I developed a practical, outcome-driven approach to 
                    cybersecurity, with a strong focus on accuracy, context, and resilience.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am technically versatile, with experience across KQL-driven threat hunting and log analysis, SIEM technologies, and multiple programming and scripting 
                    languages including Python, SQL, Java, JavaScript, and C, alongside web technologies such as HTML and CSS. I have also engaged in industry-led practical 
                    programs with organizations such as Mastercard, Visa, Telstra, and AIG, broadening my exposure to enterprise security challenges and best practices.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Combining strong academic performance with real-world SOC and CTI experience, I bring a disciplined, analytical, and adaptable mindset to cybersecurity. 
                    I am driven by continuous learning and the application of intelligence-led security practices to help strengthen digital environments against evolving threats.
