            <p class="about-design-p">
                <br>
                As an intern at Dyson <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dyson/" target="_blank" style="color: #00abf0;">( https://www.linkedin.com/company/dyson/ )</a>, 
                specializing in Cyber Defense within the Blue Team, I transitioned into the SOC analyst role with enthusiasm and dedication. Despite lacking previous industry 
                experience, my proactive approach and passion for learning allowed me to significantly contribute to critical projects, rapidly 
                advancing my cybersecurity expertise over a six-month period in CDO Team (Cyber Defense Team). My internship commenced in the Cyber Defense Operations (CDO) team, 
                where I dedicated the initial six months, followed by a shift to the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) team for the remaining period. This diverse experience allowed 
                me to develop a comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity from multiple operational perspectives.
                <br><br>
                In my role as a SOC analyst, my daily responsibilities included:
                <br><br>
                <b>- Incident Response and Alert Management:</b> Utilized ServiceNow for effective alert triage, closing tickets after thorough investigations, and engaging in 
                incident response. This required a keen eye for detail and the ability to respond swiftly to emerging threats.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>- Security Tools Proficiency (SIEM & SOAR):</b> Demonstrated skilled use of cutting-edge cybersecurity tools, such as SIEM systems, XDR platforms, and Azure's security suite 
                (Sentinel, Defender, and Entra ID). These tools were integral in monitoring network activities and enabling proactive threat detection and hunting, ensuring 
                robust security defenses.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>- Cybersecurity Use Case Development and Automation:</b> Actively contributed to the creation of strategic cybersecurity use cases. My involvement was pivotal in 
                automating processes, which enhanced our team's efficiency and effectiveness in threat management. Additionally, I took a lead role in the development and 
                management of workbooks for meticulous security data analysis, accompanied by comprehensive documentation.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>- Infrastructure Configuration and Documentation:</b> Collaborated extensively with multiple teams to configure servers on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Linux, 
                managing this project's detailed documentation autonomously. This task required a deep understanding of server settings and network configurations to maintain high 
                security and performance standards.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>- Security Data Analysis and Workbook Maintenance:</b> Played a vital role in both the creation and ongoing maintenance of workbooks designed for detailed tracking 
                and analysis of security data. This responsibility ensured that our team had access to precise and actionable insights for improving our security posture.
                <br><br>
                These experiences as an L1 SOC analyst have equipped me with foundational skills necessary for a cybersecurity career, including vigilant monitoring of network 
                security, rapid response to incidents, and effective collaboration with diverse teams to fortify digital defenses.                
                <br><br>
                I am currently working as a CTI Member as end of internship and my responsibilities will be updated here later.

                ,where I studied for 2 years and completed my 11th and 12th Standard as per Nepalese Education System which can also be
                considered as pre-university curriculum or Senior Secondary Education System. This level is equivalent to A Levels in UK and EMEA region. The subjects I 
                majored while my time in College are:<br><br>
                English (Cambridge University Based), Computer Science, Business Mathematics/Nepali, Accountancy and Economics.
                <br><br>
                I majored on 5 subjects while my time in College for 2 years focusing especially on Computer Science, where my journey to programming started thanks to 
                their very hard and focused course. At the end of the College, I was assigned to make a full-fledge working C Programming code where I have to demonstrate
                my skills and knowledge based on my topic and passed my exam SLC [ School Leaving Certificate ] with Grade: CGPA 3.72 ( A+ - Distinction ). 
                <br><br> 
                <b>Key Learnings:</b>
                <br><br>
                I learned C programming through coursework and practice, which included writing code, debugging programs, and creating projects. As part of my coursework, 
                I completed multiple C programming projects that tested my understanding of programming concepts such as data types, control structures, and functions. 
                Through this experience, I developed proficiency in the C programming language and gained practical experience in applying it to real-world projects.
                <br><br>
                I have a solid understanding of fundamental programming concepts, such as data types, control structures, and functions, as well as more advanced topics 
                like pointers and memory management. My experience has taught me to write efficient and effective code, and I am comfortable debugging and troubleshooting 
                programs. Through my projects, I have gained knowledge in implementing algorithms, manipulating data structures, and developing efficient solutions to complex
                problems. <br><br>
                Furthermore, I learned about HTML and CSS as part of my coursework in web development. As a final project, I designed and developed a website about 
                the Juventus Club, demonstrating my knowledge of HTML and CSS. This project required me to apply my skills to create an attractive and functional website, 
                incorporating multimedia elements and interactive features. I received an A+ grade for my work, which showcased my attention to detail, creativity, and ability to 
                develop high-quality websites.
